**Assessment 1: MLP task in image classification**

---

The main purpose of this assessment was to use MLP to conduct classification.

The main script is the "main.m", which includes the rudimentary format of MLP. I used the grid search to return the optimal hyperparameter and used the confusion matrix to visualize the result. 

Owing to the requirements, we have to use the sigmoid as the activation function in each layer. Therefore, the final performance is not ideal enough
